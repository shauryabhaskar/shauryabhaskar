## Hi there 👋

I’m Shaurya Bhaskar, an AI and software engineering enthusiast from India.

I build things that blend creativity with code, especially AI systems that can generate, visualize, and automate ideas.

If a concept interests me, I’ll experiment with it, refine it, and ship it.

My primary tech stack consists of Python, Java, Stable Diffusion XL, LoRA, ControlNet, and OpenCV. My favorite tools are VS Code, Jupyter Notebook, and GitHub Copilot.

I have a number of pinned projects, but my favorite is Comic Crafter AI.

More projects are on the way, and I’m also getting into cybersecurity.

Fun Facts:
I love training AI models and building creative tools
I go to the gym and want an athletic, functional physique
I prefer clean, logical code over complicated solutions


Hobbies: sports, gym, building things
